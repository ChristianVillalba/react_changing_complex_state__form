## Notes

### Complex State
This project is about managing the state of Javascript Objects     
where we have to retrieve the previous value of the Object.

We already have some experience using [React: Forms](https://github.com/ChristianVillalba/React_forms.git)       
But when we have too many inputs, 
We would have too many functions and separate constants,       
even though those pieces of information probably should be associated with each other       
(eg: in this project, First Name & Last Name should be associated to the same person).


<!-- eg: Challange 1
added an input to the website
I want to be able to greet the user using both of these pieces of information 
so that when they type their first name, it says hello 
and then adds the first name to the
and then when they add their last name, the first name is still there and it's still stateful.
And the last name also updates and is independent from the first name. -->
